I honestly had a lot of fun making this because I love making weird abstract stories about the unknown. The theme I first followed in making this story was a simple one like good and bad but it then evolved into more complex themes of curiosity, compassion, empathy, and even defiance. Honestly just play it and tell me what YOU think!"
